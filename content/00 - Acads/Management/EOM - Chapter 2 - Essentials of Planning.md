# Introduction and its Importance
### What is planning? 
A plan is a blueprint for goal achievement, a blueprint that specifies the necessary resource allocations, schedules, tasks and other actions to achieve the purpose.

### Planning answers the following 6 basic questions
1. *What needs to be accomplished? What are the alternative routes to it?*
2. *When is the deadline?*
3. *Where will this be done?*
4. *Who will be responsible for it?*
5. *How will it get done?*
6. *How much time, energy and resources are required to accomplish this goal?*

# 8 Types of Plans
## 1. Purpose or Mission or Vision
Consists of the:
1. **Mission statement**: What the company represents and values.
2. **Vision Statement**: What the company wishes to become.
3. **Strategy and Goals**: How the company strives to achieve its vision. 
## 2. Goal or Objective
Objectives are defined as the important ends towards which organizational and individual activities are directed.
**Verifiable Objectives**: Facilitate measurement of surplus as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of managerial actions.
## 3. Strategy
A comprehensive and all-inclusive plan to achieve said goals or objectives. A strategy is a plan that has 3 specific dimensions:
1. Establishing long-term objectives
2. Selecting a specific course of action
3. Allocating necessary resources needed for the plan. 
Forming strategy is generally reserved for the top level of management. 
## 4. Policy
Policies are also the plans in that they are general statements or in-company-understandings that guide thinking in decision making. 
Not all policies are hard-written, some are merely implied from managerial action.
(Example -> the practice of promoting from within, hiring university trained engineers, encouraging employee suggestion etc). 

Policies define an area within which a decision is made and ensure that the decision will be consistent with and contribute to the objective.
## 5. Procedure
Described in a chronological order, procedures are a stepwise guide for the routine to carry out the activities. 
## 6. Rules
Very specific statements that define an action or non-action. Non-flexible. They are the simplest type of plan. The guide actions without specifying a time sequence. Rules may or may not be part of procedure.
## 7. Programs
Programs are a complex of goals, policies, procedures, rules, task assignments, steps to be taken, resources to be employed and other elements necessary to carry out a given course of action. 
They are ordinarily supported by Budgets. 
## 8. Budgets
Budgest are the statement of **expected results expresses in numerical terms** referred to as *numberized programs*. 

Can be in terms of number of labour hours, units of production, financial terms, machine-hours etc. Budgets usually implement a program
1. Variable or flexible budgets
2. Program budgets
3. Zero based budgets

# Planning Classification
1. **Level**: Corporate, Business, Functional
2. **Importance**: Strategic, Operational
3. **Formality**: Formal, Informal
4. **Approach**: Proactive, Reactive
5. **Period**: Short-term, Long-term

The most popular ways to describe lans are in the terms of their **CONTENT, BREADTH, TIME-FRAME, SPECIFICITY** and **FREQUENCY OF USE**. 

1. **CONTENT (Strategic, Tactical and Operational)**: Upper level managers develop the strategic plans that apply to the entire organization. Lower level managers focus on tactical plans, that specify how the overall objectives will be achieved. Opeartional plans are limited in scope and are measured daily, weekly or monthly whereas strategic plans are broader, less specific and encompass five or more years. 
2. **BREADTH (Strategic vs Tactical)**
3. **TIME FRAME (Long-term vs Short-term)**:
4. **SPECIFICITY (Directional vs Specific)**: 
5. **FREQUENCY OF USE (Single Use vs Standing)**:  5 years plus vs upto 1 year.

# Mangement by Objectives (MBO)
A strategic management model that aims to improve the performance of an organization by clearly defining objectives that are agreed upon by both management and employees. Managers and employees define objectives for every department, project and person and use them to monitor subsequent progress.

MBO emphasizes on the following:
- Peformance appraisal
- Short term objectives and motivation
- Long-term planning

Key Result Areas -> Areas in which performance is critical to the success of the enterprise.

## Verifiable vs Non-Verifiable Objectives

| Verifiable Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Non-Verifiable Objectives    |

# Systems Approach to Management
An organization is made up of many inter-related sub-systems. Sub-systems should be studied in their inter-relationships rather than in mutual isolation.

## Strategic Tools
### Critical Question Analysis
- What is our business? Glass bottle manufacturers missed their opportunities by seeing themselves for too long as glass bottle makers rather than as liquid container manufacturers while plastic and metal containers come to replace glass in many cases.
- Who are our customers? 
- What do our customers want? 
- How much will our customers buy and at what price? 
- Do we wish to be a product leader? 
- Do we wish to develop our own new products? 

### Blue Ocean Strategy
It is a unique approach to business. It's growth that encourages companies to create new market spaces instead of competing in saturated markets. Success can be found in **blue oceans** - untapped, uncontested market spaces ripe for growth.

The **Blue Ocean Strategy** pivots on two main principles:
1. **Value Innovation**: This involves delivering superior value to customers through differentiation and low cost. It beats the competition by making it irrelevant by redefining industry boundaries. 
2. **Creation of Uncontested Market Space**

#### Advantages:
1. Businesses can create new demand and tap into new markets.
2. Businesses can focus on creating unique value propositions that are appealing to customers. 
3. Businesses can avoid the cutthroat competition of traditional markets. 
4. Businesses can achieve sustained profitability.

#### Challenges:
1. High risk of failure.
2. Significant resource investment.
3. Uncertainty of unexplored markets.

| Align the whole system of a firm's activities with its **strategic choice of differentitation or low-cost** | Align the whole system of a firm's activities in **pursuit of differentiation and low cost** |
Examples -> Flipkart with grocery delivery, PayTM with a new, more convenient way of digital transactions.

#### Four Actions Framework for Blue Ocean
1. **E**liminate -> eliminate factors on which the company has been competing. 
2. **R**educe several factors below the company standards. 
3. **R**aise key factors that will assist in making the competition irrelevant above the standards.
4. **C**reate some new ideas, factors and steps that the company needs to achieve its blue ocean goal. 

### SWOT Analysis
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
![[SWOT-analysis-template.png]]
Here we have an example exercise, a SWOT analysis done on a car manufacturing company that has recently launched its EV products. 
![[swot-exercise-ev-manufacturing-example.png]]
### TOWS Matrix
![[tows-matrix-template.png]]
#### Case Study of Apple
1. **SO** -> Apple's **strengths** are strong brand awareness and customer loyalty along with strong capabilities in product design and aesthetics. Combining these with the growing popularity of touchscreen smartphones which was a good **opportunity**, is what led to the launch of the first iphone. 
2. **ST** -> Apple's **strengths** are its product design and strong brand loyalty. It took advantage of these strengths by keeping its lightning connector propreitary, thus driving revenue. However, now Apple faces a **threat** in the EU where local regulators are forcing Apple to adopt Type-C in its devices to reduce unnecessary electronic waste. This could have led to a significant loss in revenue, but by capitalising on its brand loyalty, a sizeable portion of its consumers will buy Apple's Type-C over cheaper Type-C alternatives.
3. **WO** -> Apple's **weakness** is its smaller product portfolio, thus Apple is not the quickest to capitalize on latest market trends and gaps. Apple overcame its weakness when the **opportunity** of wearables started gaining traction with its own line of wearables which proved to be a success.
4. **WT** -> Weakness is its digital media sector. The threat is that this sector is growing day by day. Apple TV+ is a WT strategy.

### Business Portfolio Analysis (BCG Matrix)
![[bcg-matrix-template.png]]
#### Why BCG Matrix? 
To assess:
- Profiles of products/businesses
- Cash demands of products
- Product development cycles
- Resource allocation and divestment decisions
#### Question Marks
- Most businesses start out as question marks. 
- Can turn into stars and eventually cash cows but can also become a dog.
- Investments should be high for question marks.
#### Stars
- Market leaders, require heavy investment to maintain its large market share
- Attempts should be made to hold market growth otherwise it will turn into a cash cow. 

#### Cash Cows
- Foundation of the company, stars of yesterday. 
- Generate more cash than required.
- Extract profits by investing as little as possible.
- Located in a mature industry, not growing or declining.

#### Dogs
- Cash traps, no potential to bring in much cash.
- Must be minimized. 
- Business is situated in a declining stage.
