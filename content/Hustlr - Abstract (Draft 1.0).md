## Hustlr
Trustworthy Student-Powered Real-Life Services for the Indian Market

## Overview
Hustlr is a platform designed to connect students with local communities, enabling them to provide small, everyday services that require trust, reliability, and a personal touch. By exclusively recruiting students from recognized universities, the platform capitalizes on the inherent trust people place in studentsâ€”especially when their academic backgrounds are visible. Clients can hire students for a range of services, from tech support for seniors to freelance photography, with the confidence of knowing the provider is a verified student.

## Key Idea
Hustlr is built on the premise that people are more comfortable hiring students for personal or small tasks due to the perception of them being safe, trustworthy, and approachable. Unlike generalized gig platforms, Hustlr offers the reassurance that all service providers are vetted students from accredited institutions, with their university affiliation and academic background visible to clients during the hiring process. This creates a unique bond of trust between the student service provider and the client.
